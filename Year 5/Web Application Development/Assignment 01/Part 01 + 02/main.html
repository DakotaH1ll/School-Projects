        <p>Professional wrestling (often shortened to pro wrestling or simply
          wrestling) is a form of performance art which combines athletics with theatrical
          performance. It takes the form of events, held by touring companies,
          which mimic a title match combat sport. The unique form of sport
          portrayed is fundamentally based on classical and "catch" wrestling,
          with modern additions of striking attacks, strength-based holds and
          throws and acrobatic maneuvers, much of these derive from the influence
          of various international martial arts. An additional aspect of combat
          with improvised weaponry is sometimes included to varying degrees. The
          matches have predetermined outcomes to heighten entertainment value and
          all combative maneuvers are executed with the full cooperation of those
          involved and carefully performed in specific manners intended to
          lessen the chance of actual injury. These facts were once kept highly
          secretive, but are now a widely accepted open secret. By and large, the
          true nature of the performance is not discussed by the performing
          company in official media to sustain and promote the willing suspension
          of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude.
          Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through
          outside media (i.e. interviews) will often directly acknowledge the
          dramatic and "fixed" nature of the spectacle.</p>

        <p>Matches are held between two or more sides ("corners"). Each corner may
          consist of one wrestler, or a team of two or more. The standard method
          of scoring is the "fall", which is accomplished by: Pinning the opponent's
          shoulders to the mat, typically for three seconds (though other times
          have been used), Forcing the opponent to submit, Disqualification of
          the opponent, The opponent remaining outside the ring for too long
          (countout) or Knocking out or otherwise incapacitating the opponent.
          To score by pinfall, a wrestler must pin both his opponent's shoulders
          against the mat while the referee slaps the mat three times (referred
          to as a "three count"). This is the most common form of defeat. The
          pinned wrestler must also be on his back and, if s/he is lying on his
          stomach, it usually does not count. A count may be started at any time
          that a wrestler's shoulders are down (both shoulders touching the mat),
          back-first and any part of the opponent's body is lying over the wrestler.

      <div class="body">
        <p>Originating as a popular form of entertainment in 19th-century Europe
          and later as a sideshow exhibition in North American traveling carnivals
          and vaudeville halls, professional wrestling grew into a standalone
          genre of entertainment with many diverse variations in cultures
          around the globe, and is now considered a billion dollar entertainment
          industry. While since the 1980s local forms have greatly declined
          in Europe, wrestling from North America has experienced several
          different periods of prominent cultural popularity during its century
          and a half of existence and has been exported back to Europe to fill
          the cultural gap left by the aforementioned decline of local
          versions. The advent of television gave professional wrestling
          a new outlet, and wrestling (along with boxing) was instrumental
          in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery.</p>
